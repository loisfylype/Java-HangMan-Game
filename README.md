## My alterations:
Make it Object-Oriented, and refactored some variables and functions names.

## How to play:
### Single player english version:
Just run Main.java and choose the game mode with the write 's' character.

### Multiplayer:
Run Main.java chose the game mode writing any character, and write a word for your opponent,
and wait for the discovery or not the word.
